# Breathe
Air quality tracking system based on a lot of moving sensors

# Concept

By utilizing moving sensors, we aim to achieve a more detailed air quality map than adopted ones based on static sensors.
We plan to incentivize drivers, joggers, cyclists to contribute data by carrying sensors with them.

# Features

Explore the air quality of given a location.

Generate heatmap about the air quality using data from a lot of gas sensors which are attached to vechicles.
Suggest best routes considering the air quality in the area.
