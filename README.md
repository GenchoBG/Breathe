# Breathe
Air quality tracking system based on a lot of moving sensors

# Concept

By utilizing moving sensors, we aim to achieve a more detailed air quality map than adopted ones based on static sensors.
We plan to incentivize drivers, joggers, cyclists to contribute data by carrying sensors with them.

# Features

Explore the air quality of given a location.

Generate heatmap about the air quality using data from a lot of gas sensors which are attached to vechicles.
Suggest best routes considering the air quality in the area.

# Current solution
- The current soutions use static sensors and the air quality measurements is not detailed enough.

# Results
- People will be more aware of the air quality.
- People will contribute for measuring air polution.

# Technologies
- React
- Arduino and IoT
- Big Data
- BigQuery
- ASP.NET Core
- Data visualization
